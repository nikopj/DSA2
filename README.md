Cooper Union: Data Structures and Algorithms II

### MERGE
Consistent with the 1998 Regional ACM contest, this program determines, of the three strings provided, whether or not the third string is a valid merge of the first two. Dynamic programming is used to avoid an exponential solution.

### GRAPH
Implements a graph class able to perform Dijkstra's Algorithm. Class is built upon the previously implemented heap and hash-table classes.

### PRIORITY QUEUE
Implements a priority queue via a binary heap class. The hash-table class implemented in the spellcheck program is used for constant time node retrieval from IDs.

### SPELLCHECK
Implements a hash-table class used to store a dictionary which can be used to spell check documents.
